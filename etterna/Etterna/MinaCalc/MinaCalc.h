	 * a file that should arguably have a _higher_ stamina tax, due to constant
	 * pattern type swapping. As of this commit this is adjusted for in js/hs.
	 * The second is that pattern mods that push down to extreme degrees stuff
	 * like jumptrills, or roll walls, will also implicitly push down their
	 * effect on stam to the point where it may be considered a "break", even
	 * though it's really not. At best it's a very different kind of stamina
	 * drain (trill vs anchor). As of this commit this is not accounted for in
